        <h2>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h2>
        <p>Rock, Paper, Scissors is a popular hand game played between two individuals. Players choose one of three gestures: rock, paper, or scissors. The objective is to defeat the opponent by selecting a gesture that overpowers theirs. Rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. It's a game of strategy, quick thinking, and anticipation. The winner is determined by the chosen gestures, and the game is often played for fun or as a simple decision-making tool.</p>
